     1	The bustle in a house
     2	
     3	The morning after death
     4	
     5	
     6	Is solemnest of industries
     7	Enacted upon earth,â€”
     8	
     9	
    10	
    11	The sweeping up the heart,
    12	And putting love away
    13	We shall not want to use again
    14	
    15	
    16	
    17	Until eternity.
